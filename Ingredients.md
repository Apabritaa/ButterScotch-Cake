INGREDIENTS
Butterscotch sauce - Sounds surprising but guess what? The butterscotch sauce works best to give this cake that butterscotch flavor. I like it better than butterscotch extract!
All-purpose flour - regular all-purpose flour works just fine in this recipe. You can use cake flour but you will need an additional two tablespoons more for this recipe.
Eggs - use fresh large eggs - to me large eggs are about 60 grams each.
Dark brown sugar - This not just add that nice butterscotch color but also flavor. If you don't have dark brown sugar you can use light brown sugar. If you still don't have light brown sugar, the easiest trick is to use white sugar with molasses. For every one cup white sugar add 1 tbsp molasses.
Sour Cream - This adds richness to the cake, keeps it moist with a tender crumb. You can make your own homemade sour cream  Plain yogurt is also a good substitute for sour cream
