ABOUT THIS CAKE
This recipe is simple and easy and makes either one 3 layers - of 7-inch cake or two layers of 8-inch cake. It is a butter-based recipe with whipped eggs, which gives us a moist yet light and airy cake. It is a perfect cake to make for anyone who loves butterscotch.

There are three components to making this cake:

Cake layers - This a version of my light and fluffy vanilla cake with butter, whipped eggs, and butterscotch sauce in the recipe
The sauce - You can use store-bought butterscotch but homemade is so easy and takes less than 10 minutes to make. If you do decide to use my homemade recipe and video I recommend making it ahead so it has enough time to cool.
Frosting - Today, I am using a Swiss meringue buttercream (SMBC) but you can also use butterscotch buttercream.
