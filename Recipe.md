STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS (PIN)
CAKE
Grease and line 3 x 7-inch or 2 x 8-inch round cake pans.
Preheat the oven to 170 C / 340 F.
In a mixing bowl combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. And, set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment whip the eggs until light and fluffy - remove and set aside.
Next, working quickly cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy about 2 minutes.
Then, add the vanilla extract, sour cream, and butterscotch sauce - and combine well.
Next, add flour mixture and combine well but do not overmix.
Finally, fold whipped eggs into the batter.
Tip - First, combine ⅓ with a whisk to prevent lumps, Then, fold the rest in with a spatula.
Pour batter into prepared baking pans.
Bake on the center rack for 25 to 30 mins or until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.
Cool in the pan for 10 mins then invert and cool on the wire rack completely before storing or decorating.
The cake batter before baking shows the pretty color from the butterscotch sauce and dark brown sugar. 

BUTTERSCOTCH SAUCE
I shared how to make butterscotch sauce in this video.
Place the cream in a microwave-safe bowl - heat it up for 30 secs and set aside.
In a heavy-based saucepan, on medium-low heat, melt butter slowly (do not burn).
Add the brown sugar, salt, corn syrup, and lemon juice.
Stir continuously until melted - Brown sugar is quite sandy when melted.
Add the warm cream, slowly stirring continuously.
 Remove from heat when you reach your desired consistency.
Set aside to cool at room temperature for a few hours.

SWISS MERINGUE BUTTERCREAM
I shared how to make Swiss meringue buttercream in this video.
Place egg whites and sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer.
Using a whisk, place the bowl over a double boiler and constantly whip until all the sugar has dissolved and the egg whites are fairly warm (about 160 F).
Take the bowl off the heat and whip the egg whites until you have a thick meringue with stiff peaks.
Let the mixer continue to whip on medium-low until the mixer bowl feels cool to touch.
Then, gradually add butter, one cube at a time, with the mixer on medium speed.
Once all the butter is in, whip on medium-high for 2 minutes.
Lastly, add the vanilla.

BUTTERSCOTCH BALLS (OPTIONAL)
I used the dome of the cake layers with a little butterscotch sauce and buttercream. Combined together like a cake pop mixture.
Rolled the cake pop mixture into balls
Chilled them in the refrigerator for a few minutes to firm up.


ASSEMBLE
Once cooled, cut the domes off the cake layers with a serrated bread knife or cake leveler.
Brush each layer with the cooled, simple syrup (simple syrup is just boiled sugar and water - I shared the recipe here).
Place a cake layer on the cake board or cake stand.
Top with a big dollop of the frosting – spread evenly with an offset spatula or spoon, but within the piped buttercream dam/edge
Then, top the second cake layer on top followed by more buttercream
Then, place the last cake layer on top.
Place the cake in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, so the layers hold together
Crumb coat - Spread more buttercream around and top of the cake with a spatula (see video).
Chill the cake for another 15 to 30 minutes.
Second coat - then, spread more buttercream around and top fo the cake.
Use a bench scraper to smooth the sides of the cake and an offset spatula to smooth the top. Chill cake for 30 minutes.
Final smoothing - dip an off-set spatula and bench scraper in warm water and smooth the sides and top of the cake.
Chill the cake for 15 minutes.
Use the cooled but still pouring consistency butterscotch sauce as a drip on the cake. (if necessary heat for 10 seconds or more)
Finally, top with the chilled cake pops.
Enjoy.
